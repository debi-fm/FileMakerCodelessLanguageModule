# FileMaker Codeless Language Module


This is a "Codeless Language Module" for colorizing FileMaker Calculations within BBEdit. Simply place the FileMakerCalculationCLM.plist file at...

`~/Library/Application Support/BBEdit/Language Modules/`


...and then name your files with a ".fmfn" extension or otherwise choose "FileMaker Calculation" as the language type of your BBEdit file. Happy colorizing!
